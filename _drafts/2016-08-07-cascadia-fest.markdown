This is another fantastic community-run conference that gives me hope that our industry is really changing for the better. I found the same level of sincere compassion at PyCon last year which led me to the Recurse Center. What these places share in common is a genuine interest in creating a safe place for people to share and learn. Amazing things are achieved when fear and hate are removed from an environment. Creativity, inspiration, collaboration.


Here are a few things I took away from my favourite talks:

# Colour Theory and using CSS to mix colours

# API and photography

# Computer Vision, knitting, googlie-eyes

# Custom elements - Seattle Times

# HTTP/2 fairy tale! This was the best!!!

# Where in the Stack is Carmen San Francisco - a11y

# Vintage Applications at Indeed - drawing on new ideas to improve old code

# Web Workers and Service Workers

# Onboarding Heros - Shower Thoughts


# Bouhous CSS transforms and perspective

# Flipping the Table - use tables to sort data but not for layout

# SVG
