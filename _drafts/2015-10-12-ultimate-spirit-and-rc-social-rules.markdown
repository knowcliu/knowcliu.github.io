I was drawn into the team sport of [Ultimate Frisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)) many years ago by the amazingly friendly community. They were athletic, intelligent and fun. It wasn't by accident that they were able to create an environment that grew into one of the biggest team sports leagues in [Vancouver](https://www.vul.ca). What made this sport so amazing? The [Spirit of the Game!](https://www.vul.ca/content/spirit) You assume everyone is here for a fun time but that ultimately (see what I did there;) everyone really wants to win the game (it's still a competition). You add some social pressure to be nice (no one likes a jerk on their team). Then you tell everyone that they have to be an adult and self-referee the game in real-time. 

Here's how self-refereeing works. If you feel like you've been [fouled](https://www.vul.ca/content/fouls), you simply call "foul" and the game pauses while the offender either agrees or contests. If they agree that it was a foul, you get possession of the disc. However, if they contest the foul, the game rolls back to the previous play. And here's the best part: the game keeps going. *YOU MOVE ON!* There was a momentary pause where two people talked to each other like adults and resolved the conflict like respectable adults. Even if the offender contests the foul, they have no other option but to roll back the game and keep going. When they are off the field and have the luxury of hindsight, they can talk to the captains of the teams and find out what they could have done differently to prevent the foul.

The [Recurse Center]( https://www.recurse.com) has created a similar environment where they expect individuals to be well-meaning and progressive. At RC, the [social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment) are there to make the common-sense, implicit, human interactions more explicit so that everyone has a good time. An environment where each individual is held to a common standard of social interactions, is a place where everyone can participate and be a good standing citizen. Learning, growing and sharing are the ultimate goals.
