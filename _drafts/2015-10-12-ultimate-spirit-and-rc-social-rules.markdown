I was drawn into the team sport of [Ultimate Frisbee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)) many years ago by the amazingly friendly community. They were athletic, intelligent and fun. It wasn't by accident that they were able to create an environment that grew into one of the biggest team sports leagues in [Vancouver](https://www.vul.ca). What made this sport so amazing? The [Spirit of the Game!](https://www.vul.ca/content/spirit) You assume everyone is here for a fun time but that ultimatly (see what I did there;) everyone really wants to win the game (it's still a competition). You add some social pressure to be nice (no one likes a jerk on their team). Then you tell everyone that they have to be an adult and self-referee the game in real-time. 

Here's how self-refereeing works. If you feel like you've been [fouled](https://www.vul.ca/content/fouls), you simply call "foul" and the game pauses while the offender either agrees or contests. If they agree that it was a foul, you get possesion of the disc. However, if they contest the foul, the game rolls back to the previous play. And here's the best part: the game keeps going. *YOU MOVE ON!* There was a momentary pause where two people talked to each other like adults and resolved the conflict like respectable adults. Even if the offender contests the foul, they have no other option but to roll back the game and keep going. When they are off the field and have the luxary of hindsight, they can talk to the captains of the teams and find out what they could have done differently to prevent the foul.

The [Recurse Center]( https://www.recurse.com) has created a similar environment where they expect individuals to be well-meaning and progressive. Generally, the [social guidelines](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-environment) are there to make the common-sense, implicit, human interactions more explicit so that no one gets hurt. An environment where each individual is held to a common standard of social interactions, is a place where everyone can participate and be a good standing citizen. Learning, growing and sharing are the ultimate goals.

# Rule 1: No feighning surprise
- Do not use the conversation killer "OH REALLY?! You didn't know that?"
- This is really not helpful to anyone involved, even or especially if you are being sincere
- Instead, you could use this new information about your audience to navigate the discussion onto something more appropriate for everyone participating.

# Rule 2: No "Well, actually's"
- Do not interupt someone to correct minor details in the middle of their turn, or even after... it's generally not useful or helpful to correct someone like this and it puts the attention on you instead of the person speaking. This is a form of negative feedback that is disruptive. This doesn't mean you have to put up with lying, dishonest people, just that you shouldn't disrupt people to put attention on yourself. Grandstanding was probably not your intention.

# Rule 3: No back-seat driving
- Don't butt into someone's conversation with a minor point and then run away.
- Get involved if you have something to contribute so that you are truely sharing.
- You do not need to participate in all conversations. Even if you think you are being helpful, sometimes people need the opportunity to learn by going through the process of making mistakes and iterating. Sometimes, there are other people who can help and they don't get that chance if you are always jumping in to save the day. It's always good to ask first before butting in.
- Keep your voice down and be respectful of other people's environment. This means paying attention to your body language too. As the New York city subways advertise: "Stop the spread" *insert image here*

# Rule 4: No -sims (subtle or explicit)
- It is absolutly not ok to make any sort of sexist, racists, ageist, etc comment, joke or otherwise.
- There are some really dumb phrases in colloquial speak that just need to stop being said. You don't really mean to say that older women are innately bad at learning when you say "It's so easy, even my grandmother could do it", so don't say that!
- I've learned that changing my vocabulary even slightly, can make the environment a better place for everyone. For example, try using "person" in place of gendered nouns. Don't use "guys", try "you all" or "everyone" or "folks".

Most of these rules come down to turn taking in conversations. If you can think of a conversation between many people as a team sport, then you win the game by taking turns throwing the projectiles down the field to the goal. It turns out that the best players are both really great at playing the game and also really great at helping others. If you can put aside your desire to be the hero and focus on all the practice and communication needed to be an awesome team, you will have a chance at winning and being awesome at life.
